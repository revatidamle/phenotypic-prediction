# phenotypic-prediction-transcriptomic-features

Machine learning project to predict population based on 'Salmon' dataset using transcriptomic features

**Abstract**

Motivation: The main aim is to achieve the maximum accuracy in classifying the samples using multi-class
classification models.

Results: We could achieve accuracy of 91.31% by using decision tree for predicting population and sequencing
center as part of our multi label classification problem. Hence, we were able to conclude multi task learning can
reduce the complexity and provide better accuracy for each of the labels.


**Summary**

The project includes the following codes - 

1. Data pre-processing (Single label + Multi label)

2. Feature extraction (Single label + Multi label)

3. Various models (Decision tree, Random forests, SVM, Regressions) for classification (Single label + Multi label)

4. Testing the classification model - 5 fold cross validation + Unkown data (Single label + Multi label)

5. Forming a pickle file to make the model portable
